sqs2tdb version 3.50 by Axel van de Walle and with contributions to the SQS database
        from Ruoshi Sun, Qijun Hong and Sara Kadkhodaei.

Usage: sqs2tdb [options]    where the available options are:
-h   : More help.
-cp  : Copy SQS from the database to the current directory. Must specify:
       -lv=[level]
           level indicates how fine of composition mesh to use (0: only end members, 1: mid points, 
                     etc.)

        Optional: -sp=Element,Element,...  to indicate which elements to consider
                      (otherwise read from species.in if it exists).
-fit : Fit solution model from SQS energies (to be run within the desired lattice directory)
       The -sro option can also be specified (with -fit) to include short-range order effects.
       The -ew=[real] option (default: 5) lets you set the increased weight given to endmembers in 
                     the fit.
-tdb : Combine solution models from one or multiple lattices into a single .tdb file.
       add the -oc (Open Calphad) option to generate a more portable tdb file.
-mk  : Generate input file for SQS generation with mcsqs. (Usually not needed - only for experts.)
       To be run in the SQS database directory:
       /home/avdw/avdw/atat/data/sqsdb/[lattice name]
Note that -h,-mk,-cp,-fit,-tdb are mutually exclusive.

EXAMPLES

-&gt; A simple session of sqs2tdb could be:

cp ~/atat/example/vasp.wrap .
emacs vasp.wrap   #edit as needed

echo Al,Ni &gt; species.in

sqs2tdb -cp -l=FCC_A1 -lv=1
sqs2tdb -cp -l=FCC_A1 -lv=1

cd FCC_A1
foreachfile wait pwd \; runstruct_vasp

sqs2tdb -fit

Edit the file terms.in to read
1,0
2,0

sqs2tdb -fit

cd ..

(repeat the above for other lattices if necessary)

sqs2tdb -tdb

The file AL_NI.tdb would contain a valid .tdb file.

-&gt; In a more advanced example, the runstruct_vasp command could be replaced
by a job script submission containing the runstruct_vasp command.

-&gt; When there are lattice instabilities, the runstruct_vasp could be replaced by 
robustrelax_vasp -mk  #this is to be run only once (see robustrelax_vasp -h for instructions)
robustrelax_vasp -id

-&gt; If phonons are to be included (for end members) one could do:
foreachfile endmem pwd \; fitfc -si=str_relax.out -ernn=4 -ns=1 -nrr
foreachfile -d 3 wait \; runstruct_vasp -lu -w vaspf.wrap
   where vaspf.wrap contains parameters for a static run to calculate forces.
foreachfile endmem pwd \; fitfc -si=str_relax.out -f -frnn=2
foreachfile endmem pwd \; robustrelax_vasp -vib

sqs2tdb -fit

OPTIONAL input files (to placed in the topmost directory):

    exfromsgte.in : specify which phases should NOT be copied from SGTE database
                    (by default all phases for each relevant element are included,
                    but you may want to use ab initio data for virtual phase).
                    Phases are specified in the form: SGTE_[lattice]_[element]
                    e.g. SGTE_BCC_A2_AL
    subref.sed    : substitution rule (sed command to be applied to final tdb file)

OUTPUT FILES
    In addition to the *.tdb files, there is some diagnostic info available in the files 
                     fit_[property].out where property could be 
    energy, svib_ht, etc.

ADVANCED FEATURES
    In each sqs subdirectory created, there may be a file called link that contains the path to
    another directory where energy data can be found. This is useful if another structure is
    known be equivalent by symmetry. This file is created by default for equivalence within a
    given structure type can even find symmetries across structure types.
    You can also create the file yourself and the code will follow your link.

    There may also be a file called bump which indicates that a structure must be moved up in energy 
                     by the
    amount specified by the -bv option (or 5e-3 by default) to avoid degeneracy with an equivalent 
                     higher symmetry structure.
    This file is created by default (during the -cp step) when the code detects higher symmetry 
                     (e.g. a GAMMA_L12 phase with all sites occupied
    with the same type of atom is just FCC). You can delete this file if the higher-symmetry 
                     structure is not in your
    set of structures. This file is read during the -fit step.

    In summary, if you see a bump file, ask yourself if you have that structure elsewhere and put an 
                     appropriate link file.
    If you don't have that structure elsewhere, you can delete the bump file.
    The code will still work and give the right answer if you don't do this, but it will spend  more 
                     computer time.

    During the -fit step, one can specify the -sro option to include a low-order CVM approximation 
                     to the short range order.
    One can also specify the weights used to enforce better fit of the end members with the -ew 
                     option (a weight of 10 is the default).

    The default lower and upper temperature limits of 298.15K and 10000K can be changed with the 
                     -Tl=... and -Tu=... options, respectively.
    
    This code now allows for the input free energies to general CALPHAD-compatible T-dependent 
                     functions. To use this feature, place your functions
    in 'func' files and do not specify 'energy' or 'svib_ht' files.
