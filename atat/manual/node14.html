Without queueing systems</A>
</H2>

<P>
We now cover the case where there is no queueing system and the user has
full power to run on any of the nodes in the cluster.

<P>
Networking problems can be tricky and we will test various thing as we
go along.  You only need to perform this installation on your "master"
machine that will run maps.  All other machine (which we be called the
&ldquo;remote&rdquo; machines) only need to have VASP (or any other ab-initio
code).

<P>
Before you start, you must first make sure that it is possible to login from
the master machine to the remote machines without entering a
password. This is essential for the program to be able to run on its
own, without your intervention.  Don't worry it is generally possible
to do this without compromising the security of your system.
Two commands allow you to run a command on a remote machine.
If the master and remote machines are connected through a secure network
(e.g. a beowolf cluster having its own local network)
or if you don't care about security (for now), you can use <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">rsh</SPAN>.
Otherwise, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">ssh</SPAN> provides a secure way to command a machine remotely.

<P>
To set up <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">rsh</SPAN> so that you can login without typing a password, you
must have the appropriate <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">.rhosts</SPAN> file on the remote machine.
For more information, consult the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">rsh</SPAN> man page. (One important
issue, often not mentioned in the man pages, its that you need to set the file permissions
of the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">.rhosts</SPAN> file so that noone else but you has &ldquo;write&rdquo; permission:
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">chmod og-w ~/.rhosts</SPAN>).

<P>
To set up <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">ssh</SPAN> so that you can login without typing a password, consult the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">ssh</SPAN> man page, especially the
section on &ldquo;RSA-based host authentication&rdquo;. (This is the feature that makes
the login secure even if no password is needed.) In general, setting this up
involves creating a <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">.shosts</SPAN> file and generating a public key files to be
copied onto the remote machines.

<P>
If your username is different on the remote machine and if you use <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">ssh</SPAN>, use the
syntax <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">node username@host</SPAN> instead. If you use <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">rsh</SPAN>, use the syntax <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">node -l username host</SPAN>.

<P>
Once you are able to run either <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">rsh node2 ls</SPAN> or <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">ssh node2 ls</SPAN> and get the content of your
home directory on the remote machine (assuming that you have a remote machine called <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">node2</SPAN>),
you can proceed to the next step. Do you have the same home directory on the master and remote machines
and does it have the same access path? To check this, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">cd</SPAN> to some arbitrary subdirectory and type:
<table width="90%"><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">node node2 ls</SPAN></td></tr></table>

where <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">node</SPAN> is a command provided with ATAT and node2 is the name of the remote machine.
If you want to use <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">ssh</SPAN> instead, type
<table width="90%"><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">node -s node2 ls</SPAN></td></tr></table>

This should print the content of the <EM>current</EM> directory on the master machine (not your home directory).
If you get an error message or if you get the content of another directory, you will
need to check if the following works. Make sure you are in a directory that does not contain
too many files. If you want to use <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">rsh</SPAN>, type:
<table width="90%"><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">node -r node2 ls</SPAN></td></tr></table>

while if you want to use <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">ssh</SPAN>
<table width="90%"><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">node -s -r node2 ls</SPAN></td></tr></table>

In either case, you should get the content of the current directory before continuing on.
The <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">node -r</SPAN> command works by copying the content of the current directory on the remote machine
in a temporary directory. Once the command has terminated, the new content is copied back and the remote
temporary directory is deleted.

<P>
We are now ready to automate the calculations. Type
<table width="90%"><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">chl</SPAN></td></tr></table>

and, as indicated on the screen, open the file <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">~/.machines.rc</SPAN> with a text editor.
This file contains numerous comment lines explaining the format of the file and
a few examples.

<P>
The commands in the first column (before the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">+</SPAN>) must print a single number
indicating the load of the machine. It is a good check to copy and paste each
of these command, one at the time, into a shell window to see if the output is a single number.
In order to extract a single number out of a complicated output, the command <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">getvalue</SPAN> is
provided. It extracts the single number following the token given as an argument.
The first entry, with the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">none</SPAN> keyword after the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">+</SPAN> indicates the threshold
load above which a machine is considered too busy to be usable. Note that the
load checking commands may quite elaborate if, for instance, you need to &ldquo;rescale&rdquo; the load
of some machines because they have a different reporting scheme or if you want to tweak the
priority given to each machine.

<P>
The second column (after the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">+</SPAN>) give the command prefix needed to run on each
remote machine. These prefix will usually consist of the command <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">node</SPAN>
described above. It is very important that the command prefix be such that the current
directory in the remote machine when the command is run is the same as on the
local machine. The best way to test that is to try the prefix in front of the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">ls</SPAN>
command and verify that what is printed is indeed the content of the current local directory.

<P>
Once you are done with entering the information for each of your machines (you can also enter only a
few and come back later to add the remaining ones), make sure to comment out the examples provided (placing
a <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">#</SPAN> at the beginning of the unwanted line). Do not comment out the first line which contains
the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">none</SPAN> keyword.

<P>
Once you have edited the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">~/.machines.rc</SPAN> file, type <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">chl</SPAN>.
This should give a list of the load
of all machines in the first column and a list of command prefix in the second.
Next, try the command <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">minload</SPAN>. It should give the command prefix that let
you access the machine with the minimum load or <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">none</SPAN> if no machine is available.
To check, once again, that the command prefix are
correct, type <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">`minload` ls</SPAN> (make sure you use backward quotes!). This should print the content of the current
directory (unless there are no machines available).

<P>
This approach could also be used with a queueing system, but this is much more advanced and requires good knowledge of scripting languages.
You could read the &ldquo;node list file&rdquo; the queueing system assigned to the job and create a local <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">.machine.rc</SPAN> file on-the-fly.
The <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">-s</SPAN> option of <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">pollmach</SPAN> could prove helpful to ensure two vasp runs do run on the same processors, and avoids the need
for load balancing code.
