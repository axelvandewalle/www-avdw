FAQ</A>
</H1>

<P>
<B>Q. </B>I can do a least-squares by hand with a much lower mean square error (MSE) than MAPS can. Yet, you claim that MAPS
is &ldquo;optimal&rdquo;. How is this possible?

<P>
<B>A. </B>The MSE is not a very good measure of the predictive power of a cluster expansion.
It can be made arbitrarily close to zero but merely including enough ECI in the fit!
But having a small MSE is no guarantee that the error on the predicted energy of structures not inlcuded
in the fit is small. The cross-validation (CV) score, which is used in MAPS, is a better measure of the predictive
power of a least-squares fit. The CV score does not systematically decrease as the number of ECI increases
and it has been shown that choosing the number of ECI such that the CV score is minimized is an asymptotically
optimal strategy. Researchers often have a tendency to use too many ECI because this appears to reduce the error, but this
is a illusion. MAPS gives you an unbiased estimaqte of the prediction error, and the magnitude of that number is larger
than many would like to believe.

<P>
<B>Q. </B>MAPS is frozen. What is going on?

<P>
<B>A. </B>MAPS sometimes needs a few minutes to generates new clusters or structures. This is a complex operation, be patient.
This generation can occur in the middle of the calculations (finding the best cluster expansion or the best structures)
because MAPS only generates these clusters or structures when they are needed.

<P>
<B>Q. </B>Where are the results?

<P>
<B>A. </B>In a variety of files whose descriptions you can view by typing <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">maps -h | more</SPAN>. A utility called <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">mapsrep</SPAN>
lets you display the most useful output data using <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">gnuplot</SPAN>.

<P>
<B>Q. </B>What files do I need to get started with MAPS?

<P>
<B>A. </B>A <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">lat.in</SPAN> files to specify the geometry of the lattice and a &ldquo;wrapping&rdquo; file that specifies the parameters
of the first-principles code. If you are using vasp, this file is usually called <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">vasp.wrap</SPAN>. Examples of those
files can be found in the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">example</SPAN> directory.

<P>
<B>Q. </B>I already have structures and energies. What if I just want to fit them?

<P>
<B>A. </B>You need a <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">lat.in</SPAN> files to specify the geometry of the lattice and you need to create
one subdirectory for each structure (name them as you which). In each subdirectory, you need a
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">str.out</SPAN> file to specify the geometry of the structure and an <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">energy</SPAN> file to indicate the
energy of that structure. For the format of those files, type <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">maps -h | more</SPAN>. Note that the
energy must per unit cell of the structure (not the lattice).

<P>
<B>Q. </B>When I type <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">maps</SPAN> I only get the command line option help. How can I run it?

<P>
<B>A. </B>Type <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">maps -d</SPAN> to use all the default options. You can also specify any option you want.
Either way, the help message will not be displayed and the code will run.
If the help is still displayed, it is because there is an error in the options you specified.

<P>
<B>Q. </B>When I superimpose the energies of <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">fit.out</SPAN> with the energies obtained from the Monte Carlo code, I can see
that they don't match. What is happening?

<P>
<B>A. </B>The &ldquo;energies&rdquo; given by the Monte Carlo code are in fact <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.17ex; vertical-align: -0.57ex; " SRC="img69.png"
 ALT="$E-\mu x$"></SPAN> so you need to add <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.61ex; vertical-align: -0.57ex; " SRC="img62.png"
 ALT="$\mu x$"></SPAN> to get the true energy. Use the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">-g2c</SPAN> option to tell the Monte Carlo code to output the true energy.

<P>
<B>Q. </B>How can I verify that the structures do not relax to a superstructure of a different type of lattice (e.g. fcc becoming bcc)?

<P>
<B>A. </B>Run the utility called <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">checkrelax</SPAN>. It will give you a list all structures along with a measure of the strain they each experienced
during relaxation.

<P>
<B>Q. </B>When I look at the calculated and fitted energies in the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">fit.out</SPAN> file there are structures where the difference
is very large.

<P>
<B>A. </B>Make sure that these structures have properly relaxed. A common problem is to start the first-principles calculations
with an unrelaxed geometry where the atoms are too close to one another. Restart the energy calculations of the offending structures
by using larger starting volumes.

<P>
<B>Q. </B>My input files seem correct but ATAT utilities crash while reading them.

<P>
<B>A. </B>Make sure your files have unix-style end-of-lines. The <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">fixeol -u yourinputfile</SPAN> command should fix that issue.

<P>
