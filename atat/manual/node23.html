<P>
While the calculations are running, you can check on the status of the best cluster
expansion obtained so far. The file <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">log.out</SPAN> contains a brief description of the
status of the calculations, such as the accuracy of the cluster expansion and various
warning messages. Most of the messages pertains to the accurate prediction
of the so-called ground states of the alloy system. The ground states, which are the structures that
have the lowest energy for each given concentration, are extremely important to predict accurately
because they determine which phases will appear on the phase diagram.
The four possible messages are described below.

<UL>
<LI><SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Not enough known energies to fit CE.</SPAN> 
Before displaying any results, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">maps</SPAN> waits until enough structural energies are known
to fit a minimal cluster expansion containing only nearest-neighbor pair interactions
and test its accuracy. Thus, the first cluster expansion is typically constructed
after at least 4 structural energies have been computed (this number may vary as a function
of the symmetry of the lattice). 
</LI>
<LI><SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Among structures of known energy, true ground states differ from fitted ground
<BR>
states.</SPAN> 
The current cluster expansion incorrectly predicts which structures have the lowest
 energy for given concentrations, among structures whose first-principles energy is known.
The code has built-in checks to avoid this.
However, in rare instances, it may be mathematically impossible to satisfy all the constraints 
that the code imposes for a cluster expansion to be acceptable.
 This problem becomes increasingly unlikely as the number of calculated structural energies increases, 
so the user should just wait until the problem fixes itself. 
</LI>
<LI><SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Among structures of known energy, true and predicted ground states agree.</SPAN> 
Opposite of the previous message. When this message is displayed, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">maps</SPAN> also displays either one of
the following two messages.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN style="font-family:monospace">New ground states of volume less or equal to</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.12ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img22.png"
 ALT="$n$"></SPAN> <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">predicted, see predstr.out.</SPAN> 
This indicates that the cluster expansion predicts that, at some concentration, there exist other structures 
that should have an energy even lower than the one of the structures whose energy has been calculated 
from first principles. In this case, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">maps</SPAN>
will investigate the matter by generating those structures and requesting that their energy be
calculated. Once again, the user should just wait for the problem to fix itself.
The predicted ground states are flagged by a <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">g</SPAN> in the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">predstr.out</SPAN> file, so
that you can display their energy by typing <table width="90%"><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">grep g predstr.out</SPAN></td></tr></table>

</LI>
<LI><SPAN style="font-family:monospace">No other ground states of</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.12ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img22.png"
 ALT="$n$"></SPAN> <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">atoms/unit cell or less exist.</SPAN>
The energies of all ground states predicted by the cluster expansion have been confirmed by first-principles calculations. Because it can be computationally intensive to perform a full
ground state search when interactions extend beyond the nearest-neighbor shell [<A
 HREF="node30.html#ducastelle:book">6</A>], <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">maps</SPAN> uses a search algorithm that merely enumerates every possible
structures having <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.12ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img22.png"
 ALT="$n$"></SPAN> atoms or less per unit cell and uses the cluster expansion to predict their energies. The upper limit <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.12ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img22.png"
 ALT="$n$"></SPAN> increases automatically as calculations
progress.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">log.out</SPAN> file also contains two other pieces of information:

<UL>
<LI><SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Concentration range used for ground state checking: [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.12ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img16.png"
 ALT="$a$"></SPAN>,<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.68ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img17.png"
 ALT="$b$"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:monospace">]</SPAN> This displays the user-selected range of concentration over which ground state checking is performed (which can be specified as a command-line option of the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">maps</SPAN> command: 
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">-c0=</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.12ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img16.png"
 ALT="$a$"></SPAN> <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">-c1=</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.68ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img17.png"
 ALT="$b$"></SPAN>).
It may be useful to relax the constraints that ground states be correctly reproduced over the whole
concentration range when it is known that other parent lattices are stable in some concentration range. In this fashion, the code can focus on providing a higher accuracy in the concentration range where the user needs it.
</LI>

 ALT="$s$"></SPAN>. This provides the predictive power of the cluster
expansion. It is analogous to the root mean square error, except that it is specifically
designed to estimate the error made in predicting the energy for structures not included
in the least-squares fit [<A

The <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">maps</SPAN> code also outputs quantitative data in various output files. The simplest
way to analyze this data is by typing
<table width="90%"><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">mapsrep</SPAN></td></tr></table>

As illustrated in Figure <A HREF="#mapsrep">5.2</A>, this command displays, in turn

<UL>
<LI>The <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">log.out</SPAN> file described earlier.
</LI>
<LI>The formation energy of all structures whose energy is known from first-principles calculations,
as well as the predicted energy of all structures <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">maps</SPAN> has in memory. The convex hull of the ground states among structures of known energy is overlaid
while the new predicted ground states (if any) are marked by an &ldquo;<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.31ex; " SRC="img28.png"
 ALT="$\times$"></SPAN>&rdquo;.
(Note that this ground state line is only meaningful if the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">log.out</SPAN> file contains &ldquo;<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Among structures of known energy, true and predicted ground states agree.</SPAN>&rdquo;)
</LI>
<LI>The formation energy of all structures calculated from first principles and associated ground state line.
</LI>
<LI>A plot of the magnitude of the Effective Cluster Interactions (ECI) as a function of the diameter of their associated cluster (defined as the
maximum distance between any two sites in the cluster). Pairs, triplets, etc. are plotted
consecutively. This plot is useful to assess the convergence of the cluster expansion.
When the magnitude of the ECI for the larger clusters has clearly decayed to a negligible value 
(relative to the nearest-neighbor pair ECI), this is indicative of a well-converged
cluster expansion.
</LI>
<LI>A plot of the residuals of the fit (<I>i.e.</I> the fitting error) for each structure. This
information is useful to locate potential problems in the first-principles calculations.
Indeed, when first-principles calculations exhibit numerical problems, this typically results in calculated energies that are poorly reproduced by the cluster expansion.

When the user is satisfied with the results (which are constantly updated), 
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">maps</SPAN> can be stopped by creating a file called <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">stop</SPAN> in the current directory
using the command:

while the job dispatching system can be stopped by typing:

A cluster expansion can be considered satisfactory when

<LI>All ground states are correctly reproduced and no new ground states are predicted.

<LI>The crossvalidation score, as given in the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">log.out</SPAN> file, is small (typically less than 0.025 eV).
