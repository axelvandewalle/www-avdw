<H1>Relating Fractal Image Compression to Transform Methods</H1>
<EM>by Axel van de Walle</EM>

<H2>Abstract</H2>

The purpose of this thesis is to show that
fractal image compression can be studied
with the same point of view
as conventional image compression techniques.<P>

The first chapter presents a quick overview of most conventional signal
compression techniques: Huffman and arithmetic coding,
vector quantization, predictive coding and (Karhunen-Lo&egrave;ve)
transform methods.<P>

Another chapter is devoted specifically to transform methods
applied to image compression.
Fundamental statistical properties of images are investigated, such
as translation and scale invariance, average continuity of images
and the decay of their power spectra. These properties
are then related to one another and used to introduce the well
known discrete cosine transform and orthogonal wavelet transforms.
An overview of the so-called ``zerotree'' scheme used in wavelet compression
is also given.<P>

In the final chapter, fractal image compression is introduced and
is related to the conventional methods previously introduced.
A statistical justification of fractal compression, inspired
from transform methods, is given.
The main result of this thesis is then presented:
the development of a compression
scheme which reduces to wavelet compression in one limit and to
conventional fractal image compression in another limit.<P>

This new algorithm addresses most weaknesses of fractal image compression:
it avoids the so-called ``tiling'' effect, reduces compression
and decompression time, increases compression ratio
and requires weaker criteria to guarantee
convergence of the decompression algorithm.<P>
